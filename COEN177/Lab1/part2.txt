# Description: This file contains all observations for Part 1 of Lab 1.


Observations:

The script works as designed, initially denying access to the user as if [ $user = "salagtash" ] does not match my terminal user.

Once changed to match my session's user, the script prompts for a height and width. It then correctly displays the area of
a rectangle created using these measurements.

A prompt is then given to the user to proceed with another rectangle, or terminate. It should be noted that it is case-sensitive,
so typing 'no' would not successfully terminate the program. Any other text input than "No" will result in a second area being
calculated.
